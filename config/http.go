	// ReadTimeout is the maximum duration for reading the entire

	// Because ReadTimeout does not let Handlers make per-request

	// ReadHeaderTimeout is the amount of time allowed to read
	// request headers. The connection's read deadline is reset
	// after reading the headers and the Handler can decide what
	// is considered too slow for the body. If ReadHeaderTimeout
	// is zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used. If both are
	// zero, there is no timeout.

	// WriteTimeout is the maximum duration before timing out
	// writes of the response. It is reset whenever a new
	// request's header is read. Like ReadTimeout, it does not
	// let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
	WriteTimeout time.Duration

	// IdleTimeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the

	// zero, there is no timeout.
	IdleTimeout time.Duration // Go 1.8

	// MaxHeaderBytes controls the maximum number of bytes the
